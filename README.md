## 1. The Problem area:
Sprint 0 Capstone project idea
My area of interest is medicine. There are many opportuni7es that arise when working with medical data as it is con7nuously updated and ever evolving. Predic7ons can be made to try and forecast specific things such as the number of diseases that may be reported in a certain area or how well a certain medica7on will sell in another area based on historical trends. This project for example, aims to look at the number of Infec0ous Diseases by Disease, County, Year, and Sex in California.
The biggest challenge with this dataset is that it has almost 200,000 fields so grouping by similar labels is the best way to condense and organize. Also, according to Daniel, this dataset needs a supplementary one with addi7onal columns to add even more detail. I have found census informa7on by county and I’m in the process of integra7ng them into the original dataset.

## 2. The User:
Health Prac77oners (Doctors, Nurses, Infec7ous Disease Specialists, etc.,) are the primary users of this kind of dataset as they want to categorize certain diseases by demographic and see what other factors influence the number of cases. Government can even look at this data as it has informa7on about the state on a more comprehensive scale.
Is Disease A more rampant in areas with people from X backgrounds? Is there a stark contrast in cases by gender? These are some of the ques7ons this project aims to solve + visualize.

## 3. The Big Idea:
I believe the Machine Learning approach that best suits this project is Next Point Forecas0ng as the aim is to analyze historical data and make predic7ons on future cases and how the current influen7al factors will play a role in those outcomes. Once Machine Learning has been implemented, it can help categorize and forecast future disease cases in other loca7ons that have similar factors.

## 4. The Impact:
Taking the structured data and visualizing it helps everyone to understand what is going on. Seeing the big picture helps to get an es7mate of hotspots and areas of interest, poten7al treatment or medica7on tes7ng zones, and a way to track the diseases to es7mate spreadability or even to find pa7ent zero. Good visuals also improve learning material. AYer integra7ng the demographic informa7on, the impact is even greater as we now have the specific Infec7ous
Diseases by County and Number of Cases along with demographic informa7on for the 7meline from 2001 onwards.
## 5. The Data:
Here is the link to the dataset: h[ps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infec7ous-diseases-by-disease- county-year-and-sex-d8912
The source of the data is from the California Department of Public Health, a division of the US Government.
There are currently 189921 fields. This number can be brought down aYer cleaning and op7mizing. Census data found from h[ps://www.census.gov/
I’ll a[ach the census CSVs that I’m working to organize. I’m in the process of filtering and changing the labels to make organiza7on easier.

## 6. The Alternatives:
I had several alterna7ve ideas. First was a baking recommender model based on the inpu[ed ingredients you had in your pantry, second was the number of doctors that have started offering Telehealth services aYer Covid, and third was trying to determine how many flight upgrades for a certain airline were bought using loyalty program miles or purchased as is.
These alterna7ve areas of interest proved to be a challenge when looking for datasets that related to them. The Telehealth dataset had less than 1000 total fields, the baking recommender model isn’t usually too successful, and there would be no way of geeng the flight sales informa7on unless it was specifically given by the airline.
Overall, the Disease dataset proved to be the most fruiful, not only because of its size but because of its covered material, and poten7al to adapt future predic7ons from the findings.
