### Capstone project idea

## 1.	The Problem area: 

   My area of interest is medicine. There are many opportunities that arise when working with medical data as it is continuously updated and ever evolving. Predictions can be made to try and forecast specific things such as the number of diseases that may be reported in a certain area or how well a certain medication will sell in another area based on historical trends. This project for example, aims to look at the number of Infectious Diseases by Disease, County, Year, and Sex in California. 

The biggest challenge with this dataset is that it has almost 200,000 fields so grouping by similar labels is the best way to condense and organize. Also, according to Daniel, this dataset needs a supplementary one with additional columns to add even more detail. I have found census information by county and I’m in the process of integrating them into the original dataset. 

## 2.	The User: 

Health Practitioners (Doctors, Nurses, Infectious Disease Specialists, etc.,) are the primary users of this kind of dataset as they want to categorize certain diseases by demographic and see what other factors influence the number of cases. Government can even look at this data as it has information about the state on a more comprehensive scale. 
Is Disease A more rampant in areas with people from X backgrounds? Is there a stark contrast in cases by gender? These are some of the questions this project aims to solve + visualize. 


## 3.	The Big Idea: 

I believe the Machine Learning approach that best suits this project is Next Point Forecasting as the aim is to analyze historical data and make predictions on future cases and how the current influential factors will play a role in those outcomes. Once Machine Learning has been implemented, it can help categorize and forecast future disease cases in other locations that have similar factors.  

## 4.	The Impact: 

Taking the structured data and visualizing it helps everyone to understand what is going on. Seeing the big picture helps to get an estimate of hotspots and areas of interest, potential treatment or medication testing zones, and a way to track the diseases to estimate spreadability or even to find patient zero. Good visuals also improve learning material. After integrating the demographic information, the impact is even greater as we now have the specific Infectious Diseases by County and Number of Cases along with demographic information for the timeline from 2001 onwards. 


## 5.	The Data:
Here is the link to the dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infectious-diseases-by-disease-county-year-and-sex-d8912
The source of the data is from the California Department of Public Health, a division of the US Government.
There are currently 189921 fields. This number can be brought down after cleaning and optimizing. Census data found from https://www.census.gov/ 
I’ll attach the census CSVs that I’m working to organize. I’m in the process of filtering and changing the labels to make organization easier.  

## 6.	The Alternatives: 
I had several alternative ideas. First was a baking recommender model based on the inputted ingredients you had in your pantry, second was the number of doctors that have started offering Telehealth services after Covid, and third was trying to determine how many flight upgrades for a certain airline were bought using loyalty program miles or purchased as is. 

These alternative areas of interest proved to be a challenge when looking for datasets that related to them. The Telehealth dataset had less than 1000 total fields, the baking recommender model isn’t usually too successful, and there would be no way of getting the flight sales information unless it was specifically given by the airline. 

Overall, the Disease dataset proved to be the most fruitful, not only because of its size but because of its covered material, and potential to adapt future predictions from the findings.
